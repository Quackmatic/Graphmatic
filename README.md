Graphmatic
==========

This is my coursework for the AQA Computing A2 coursework. Features do (or will) include:

* Entering of expressions in the style of a *Casio fx-83* series calculator: *implementation complete (60%)*

* Parsing the entered expressions: *feature complete (80%)*

* Plotting those equations in graphical form: *not started (0%)*

* Entering of data sets: *implementation complete (60%)*

* Performing statistical calculations on those data sets: *not started (0%)*

* Annotating both graphs and data sets, for demonstrations on an Interactive Whiteboard: *not started (0%)*

There are 6 stages:

| Stage | Percentage | Meaning |
|:------|-----------:|:--------|
|Not Started|0%|The feature has not been started yet.|
|Started|20%|Work has started on the feature. Classes may have been set up, but no implementation is present yet.|
|Active Development|40%|The feature is being actively worked on. Issues are being resolved regarding the issue.|
|Implementation Complete|60%|The main body of the feature is complete, but some utilities may be missing, or the user experience may not be fine tuned yet (eg. no keyboard shortcuts.)|
|Feature Complete|80%|The feature is complete, but has not been extensively bug-tested or tested by the user.|
|Complete|100%|The feature is solid, bug-free, user-tested, and works as expected and described. No more work is being done on the feature except to resolve any newly discovered bugs.|
